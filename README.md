# Inspiration
The daily puzzle game genre, for the busy people who just need a little braintwister in their small moments of free time. The genre, brought to life by Wordle and NYT's puzzles, jumpstarted a wave of creative spinoffs thereafter. Our team wanted to ride the wave of new daily puzzle games with our own varient, inspired by a laser board game, leading us to the creation of our project, Lazal! 
# What it does
We have a level select that lets you select today's puzzle. The laser pointer shoots a lazer and bounces it on the mirrors to reach the goal. Currently, there is no drag system, but this is just a prototype.
# How we built it
We constructed a webapp using a combination of three frameworks, Github pages, React, and Processing. We wanted to use React in order to have a solid foundation for adding more content, as adding modules on top of our current work is simple. Although we could have linked to different pages for the different levels, but in order to save resources, we decided to route everything to the same page on the backend using a hashmap. Proccessing was the libary we chose as our team members were more expirienced with it. We also designed lots of sprites for the tiles for the full game.
# Challenges we ran into
Compiling issues and multiple errors when trying to sync up the three frameworks. 
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We believe that we had set a good starting point for the future of Lazal, as both the routing system and using react as foundation allow for managable changes in the future that aren't too resource heavy.
# What we learned
In our brainstorming process, we should have put more of a focus on how we were planning to structure our framework. We ran in to multiple errors and other difficulties thanks to attempting to sync up github pages, React, and Processing. For future hackathons, we would like to stay somewhat more in our comfort zone, so that we can truly make our ideas come to life.
# What's next for Lazar
We will turn it from a prototype to fully working, with the drag system and everything else. As it is a daily puzzle game, ideally we would be making a puzzle everyday, and keeping the past levels in the level select. We may possibly adding new tiles to the game, or even a time based leaderboard.
